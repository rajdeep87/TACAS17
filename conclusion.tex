\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we instantiate ACDCL solver with different numerical domains -- 
intervals and octagons.  Experimental evaluation on different benchmarks shows that
ACDCL is able to suitably exploit the expressivity of richer
abstract domains as well as precision of CDCL architecture.
This is attributed to the intelligent decision heuristics
which exploits the high-level structure of the problem
combined with stronger deductions and clause learning
mechanism aided by the richer abstract domains.
