\section{Contributions}
In this paper, we make the following contributions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We present a novel program analysis technique based on 
abstract conflict driven clause learning algorithm~\cite{dhk2013-popl}.
To this end, we present a procedure for lifting CDCL algorithm to 
richer lattice structure such as {\em interval} and {\em octagon} 
abstract domains.  

\item  Experiments on a set of benchmarks drawn from bit-vector 
regression suite in sv-comp, numerical programs and few 
control-intensive benchmarks from hardware domain shows that 
the strict generalization of CDCL algorithm effectively combines 
the efficiency of abstract domains while being path-sensitive and 
bit-precise at the same time.  This is attributed to the intelligent 
decision heuristics which exploits the high-level structure of the 
problem combined with stronger deductions and clause learning 
mechanism aided by the richer abstract domains.
\end{enumerate}
