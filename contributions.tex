\section{Contributions}
The goal of this paper is to instantiate ACDCL with 
different relational and non-relational numerical abstract 
domains and evaluate the performance of our program analyzer 
with program verifiers that uses propositional-level solvers. 

Experimental evaluation on different benchmarks shows that 
ACDCL is able to suitably exploit the expressivity of richer 
abstract domains as well as precision of CDCL architecture. 
This is attributed to the intelligent decision heuristics 
which exploits the high-level structure of the problem 
combined with stronger deductions and clause learning 
mechanism aided by the richer abstract domains.
