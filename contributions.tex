\section{Contributions}
In this paper, we make the following contributions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We present a novel program analysis technique that 
lift CDCL algorithm to relational numerical abstract domains.   
Our proposed technique is embodied in our tool called, {\em Titlis}.  
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instantiation of CDCL 
algorithm with relational abstract domains. 

\item We present an abstract model search algorithm that strictly 
generalizes BCP procedure to compute fix-point over template polyhedra 
domain.  Our abstract conflict analysis algorithm present a non-trivial 
lifting of the Unique Implication Point (UIP) procedure to abstract 
lattices in order to learn a generalized reason for conflicts.  
 
\item  Experiments on a set of benchmarks drawn from bit-vector 
regression suite in sv-comp, numerical programs and few 
control-intensive benchmarks from hardware domain shows that 
the strict generalization of CDCL algorithm effectively combines 
the efficiency of abstract domains while being path-sensitive and 
bit-precise at the same time.  
\end{enumerate}
