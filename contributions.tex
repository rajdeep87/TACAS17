\section{Contributions}
In this paper, we make the following contributions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We present a novel program analysis technique that 
lift CDCL algorithm to relational numerical abstract domains.   
Our proposed technique is embodied in our tool called, {\em Titlis}.  
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instantiation of CDCL 
algorithm with relational abstract domains. 
 
\item  Experiments on a set of benchmarks drawn from bit-vector 
regression suite in sv-comp, numerical programs and few 
control-intensive benchmarks from hardware domain shows that 
the strict generalization of CDCL algorithm effectively combines 
the efficiency of abstract domains while being path-sensitive and 
bit-precise at the same time.  
\end{enumerate}
