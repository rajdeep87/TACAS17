\section{Contributions}
In this paper, we have the following contributions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We present a procedure for lifting CDCL algorithm to 
relational and non-relational numerical abstract domain.  
To this end, we instatiate model search and conflict analysis 
phases of CDCL algorithm over intervals and octagon abstract 
domains.  We implement our own template-based numerical 
domains that supports complementation property, essential for 
such lifting.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
instantiation of CDCL algorithm with relational abstract domains. 
 
\item We present a new program analysis tool, {\em Titlis}, that 
is a strict generalisation of propositional CDCL algorithm.  From 
abstract interpretation perspective, {\em Titlis} uses decision 
and learning to improve the precision of abstract transformers.  
Thus, {\em Titlis} combines the efficiency of abstract domains 
while being path-sensitive and bit-precise at the same time.   
   
\item  Experiments on several numerical and control-intensive benchmarks 
shows that the proposed generalization of CDCL algorithm is able to 
suitably exploit the expressivity of richer abstract domains as well 
as precision of CDCL architecture.  This is attributed to the 
intelligent decision heuristics which exploits the high-level 
structure of the problem combined with stronger deductions and 
clause learning mechanism aided by the richer abstract domains.
