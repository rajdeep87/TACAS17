\section{Propagation Strategy}\label{deduction}
Let $L$ be the number of constraints generated by a domain $D$
for a program with $N$ variables. For $D$ = {\em Interval}, the 
maximum value of $L$ is $2*N$, whereas the maximum value of $L$ is 
$2*(N^2)$ for $D$ = {\em Octagons}. Note that the conjunction of all 
constraints in the set $L$ forms an octagon.
