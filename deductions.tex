\section{Propagation Strategy}\label{deduction}
Let $L$ be the number of constraints generated by a domain $D$
for a program with $N$ variables. For $D$ = {\em Interval}, the 
maximum value of $L$ is $2*N$, whereas the maximum value of $L$ is 
$2*(N^2)$ for $D$ = {\em Octagons}. Note that the conjunction of all 
constraints in the set $L$ forms an octagon.

Overapproximating.

\subsection{Backward Iteration Strategy}

\subsection{Chaotic Iteration Strategy}  

Let us consider an example. 
int id(int a)
{
  return a;
}

void main() {
 int x,y,z;
 _Bool c;
 if (c)
   x = -1;
 else
   x = 2;
 int k = id(x);
 z = x * k;
 assert((z!=-2));
}

With forward iteration strategy using octagon domian, the program 
is proved without any decision. However, with the forward strategy
using interval domain, we just required one decision to prove the program.
