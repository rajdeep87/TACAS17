\section{Abstract Domains}
The commonly used library for numerical abstract domains  
is the APRON C library~\cite{apron}.  This library is 
used for the static analysis of the numerical variables 
of a program by abstract interpretation. APRON provides a 
C API interface to various abstract domains and libraries 
such as {\em BOX}, {\em OCTAGON}, {\em Convex Polyhedra} and
{\em Linear Equalities} library.  The aim of such analysis is 
to compute invariants over numerical variables in the 
program~\cite{se2011}.

\subsection{Conditions for Absract Domains}
One of the requirements for a clause learning SAT solver 
is that each element of the partial assignments domain 
needs to have a decomposition into precisely complementable 
elements.  This property of the underlying domain helps 
guiding the search away from the conflicting region of the search 
space.

Thus, clause learning SAT solvers requires a weak complementation property
of the abstraction.  However, numerical abstract domain,  such as 
intervals and octagons are intersections of complementable half-spaces. 
APRON library is specialized for the abstract interpretation 
framework which does not require complementation 
operator.  To this end, we implement our own template-based 
octagon domain which supports complementation operator.  

For example, the octagon in example can be written as a conjunction of:
\[(x>=-2) \land (x<=1) \land (y>=-1) \land (y<=2) \land (x+y<=2) \land (x-y<=1) \land (y-x<=3) \land (-x-y<=2)\] 

The complementation of the above octagon can be written as disjunction of:
\[(x<-2) \lor (x>1) \lor (y<-1) \lor (y>2) \lor (x+y>2) \lor (x-y>1) \lor (y-x>3) \lor (-x-y>2)\]
