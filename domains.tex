\section{Abstract Domains}
The commonly used library for numerical abstract domains  
is the APRON C library~\cite{apron}.  This library is 
used for the static analysis of the numerical variables 
of a program by abstract interpretation. APRON provides a 
C API interface to various abstract domains and libraries 
such as {\em BOX}, {\em OCTAGON}, {\em Convex Polyhedra} and
{\em Linear Equalities} library.  The aim of such analysis is 
to compute invariants over numerical variables in the 
program~\cite{se2011}.

\subsection{Conditions for Absract Domains}
An important criterion to support clause learning in 
partial assignments domain is that elements in the 
domain must have complementation property.  Most 
numerical abstract domain does not support 
complementation operator.  Similar to the interval 
domain, octagons does not have complementation 
property, but the decomposition of octagons into 
half spaces are complementable. 

APRON library is specialized for the abstract interpretation 
framework which does not require complementation 
operator.  So, we implement our own template-based 
octagon domain which supports complementation operator.  

The octagon in example can be written as a conjunction of:
\[(x>=-2) \land (x<=1) \land (y>=-1) \land (y<=2) \land (x+y<=2) \land (x-y<=1) \land (y-x<=3) \land (-x-y<=2)\] 

The complementation of the above octagon can be written as disjunction of:
\[(x<-2) \lor (x>1) \lor (y<-1) \lor (y>2) \lor (x+y>2) \lor (x-y>1) \lor (y-x>3) \lor (-x-y>2)\]
