\section{Introduction}
%
In this paper, we identify specific properties of the CDCL algorithm that 
are necessary to lift the propositional skeleton of CDCL to other richer 
lattice structures.

Most lattice structure used in static analysis have meet and join operations 
but lack negations. The meet operation precisely model conjunction, and
the join operation over-approximate disjunction. Thus, the precision loss in 
static analyzers is often due to imprecise join operations. The loss in precision is
overcome by using richer abstract domains or equipping the analysis with disjunction --
which is often very expensive since the analysis exhibit case enumeration behavior. 
 
On the other hand, the combination of precise conjunction in partial assignments domain 
with learning allow CDCL solvers to reason about disjunction without 
enumerating cases. Learning can be viewed as synthesizing an abstract transformer for 
negation. ACDCL lifts learning techniques in SAT solver to operate on non-distributive 
lattice -- thus equipping the analysis with negation. This enables the analyzer to refine 
the analysis and prevent enumeration behavior.

\rmcmt{Our lifting of CDCL is generic for any abstract domains.  We used
octagons, equalities and intervals for our experiments.}
