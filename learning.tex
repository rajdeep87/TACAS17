\section{Abstract Conflict Analysis}\label{sec:conflict}
Conflict analysis in a SAT solver can be seen as abductive 
reasoning which underapproximates a set of models that do not satisfy a 
formula~\cite{sas12,dhk2013-popl}.  
\Omit {
where a singleton assignment $c$ is replaced by a partial 
assignment that is sufficient to infer $c$.  Thus, a conflict 
analysis is a generalization of an under-approximation of a set of 
countermodels, where a countermodel is a 
set of structures that do not satisfy a formula 
}
Since relational abstract domains have more complex structure than the partial 
assignments domain or interval domain, so finding a generalized reason for 
conflict through UIP computation~\cite{uip} is non-trivial.  We formally 
describe the adaptations of conflict analysis procedure for relational domains. %

\paragraph {\textbf{Abstract Conflict Graph}}
The first-UIP algorithm in SAT solvers works on a data structure
called {\em implication graph} and computes a cut that suffices to
produce a conflict.  The propagation and reason trails in ACDCL
implicitly encode a graph structure called {\em abstract conflict
  graph}, which records the dependencies between deductions made
during the abstract model search phase.  Nodes in the graph represent
elements of the trail $\trail$.  A node can be either a {\em decision}
node or a {\em deduction} node. Edges can be extracted from the
transformers in the reason trail $\reasons$.  Incoming arrows to node
$n$ indicate that the predecessors of $n$ are sufficient to deduce
$n$.  A decision node has no incoming edges.  For example, consider a
formula $\formula:= (y{=}x \wedge y{=}y{+}x \wedge y {\leq} 0)$ with
current abstract valuation $\absval:= (x{-}5 {\geq} 0 \wedge {-}x{+}5 {\geq}
0)$.  Figure~\ref{conflict} shows a snapshot of an abstract conflict
graph that stores the deductions obtained from abstract model search
using the octagon domain.  The last deduction conflicts with the
meet irreducible $(y \leq 0)$.

\paragraph {\textbf{Lifting UIP to relational domains}}
An UIP is a node in the abstract conflict graph such that 
any path from the last decision node to the conflict node must pass 
through it.  Unlike a SAT solver, a UIP for a relational domain may 
involve meet irreducibles that contain the same variables.  The 
first UIP is a unique node closest to the conflict, and the last UIP 
is the decision node itself.  Computing UIPs ensures asserting
cuts~\cite{cdcl,DBLP:journals/fmsd/BrainDGHK14}, that is, it 
yields clauses that generate new deductions after backtracking.  
Every cut in the graph is a reason for conflict that can be 
used in learning.  An abstract first-UIP algorithm~\cite{DBLP:journals/fmsd/BrainDGHK14} 
traverses the trail $\trail$ starting from the conflict node and 
computes a cut that suffices to produce a conflict. 
\Omit {
contradict with the transformer stored in $\reasons[\bot]$.  
}
For our example, there exist multiple incomparable reasons for conflict,
marked as {\em cut0, cut1}, in Figure~\ref{conflict}.  Here, cut0 is the first UIP.  
Choosing cut0 yields a learnt clause 
$(x+y<15 \vee -x-y<-15 \vee -x+y<5 \vee x-y<-5 \vee y-10<0 \vee -y+10<0)$, 
which is obtained by negating the reason for conflict.  
%    
\paragraph{\textbf{Learning in relational domains}}
Learning in a propositional solver yields an asserting
clause~\cite{cdcl} that expresses the negation of the conflict
reasons.  However, we model learning in relational domains as learning
a transformer which infers new meet irreducibles using the abstract
unit rule called {\em abstract unit transformer}.  We add $\aunit$ to
the set of abstract transformers $\abstransset$ used during model
search. $\aunit$ is a generalization of propositional unit rule for
numerical domains.  For an abstract lattice $\domain$ with
complementable meet irreducibles and a set of meet irreducibles $\conflictset
\subseteq \domain$ such that $\bigsqcap
\conflictset$ does not satisfy $\formula$, $\aunit_\conflictset: \domain \rightarrow
\domain$ is formally defined as follows.
\[ \aunit(\absval) =
 \left\{\begin{array}{l@{\quad}l@{\qquad}l}
  \bot       & \text{if } \absval \sqsubseteq \bigsqcap \conflictset & (1)\\
  \bar{t}    & \text{if } t \in \conflictset \; \text{and} \; \forall t' \in \conflictset
  \setminus \{t\}. \absval  \sqsubseteq t' & (2) \\
  \bar{t}    & \text{if } t \in \conflictset \; \text{and} \; \forall t' \in \conflictset \setminus \{t\}. \absval
  \not\sqsubseteq t', \; \text{then} \\ 
             & \quad \forall \absval' \sqsubseteq \absval: \absval'
             \not\sqsubseteq t \text{ and} \\ 
             & \quad \absval''=\exclude(\absval,\absval') \text{ and
             }\absval''\sqsubseteq t' & (3) \\
  \top & \text{otherwise} & (4) \\
 \end{array}\right.
\]
with $\exclude(\absval,\absval')=\bigsqcap(\decomp(\absval) \setminus
\decomp(\absval'))$.  $\aunit$ returns $\bot$ if $\conflictset$ is
conflicting following rule (1).  Rule (2) and (3) of $\aunit$ infer a
valid meet irreducible, which implies that $\conflictset$ is unit.

$\aunit$ strictly generalizes the unit rule in SAT solvers.  
However, rule (3) only applies to interval and octagons domains.  
For example, let $\conflictset = \{ x+z \geq 10, w \geq 0 \}$ be a conflicting element 
that does not satisfy $\formula$ and let $\absval= (x+y
\geq 2\wedge y+z \geq 5\wedge x+z \leq 15\wedge w \geq 1\wedge w \leq
1)$.  Applying rule (3) of $\aunit_\conflictset$, we get a
decomposition of $\absval$ into $\absval'$ and $\absval''$ where
$\absval'= (x+y \geq 2\wedge y+z \geq 5\wedge x+z \leq 15)
\not\sqsubseteq (x+z \geq 10)$, and $\absval''= (w \geq 1\wedge w \leq
1) \sqsubseteq (w \geq 0)$.  Then, $\aunit_C(a) = (x+z < 10)$, which
constrains the bound of the octagonal constraint.

Let us consider another example, where $\conflictset = \{x \geq 2, x
\leq 5, y \leq 7 \}$ and let $\absval = (x \geq 3\wedge x \leq 4\wedge
y \geq 5\wedge y \leq 6)$, then $\aunit_\conflictset(\absval) = \bot$
using the rule (1), since $\absval \sqsubseteq \bigsqcap\conflictset$.  Now,
let $\absval' = (x \geq 3\wedge x \leq 4)$, then
$\aunit_\conflictset(\absval') = (y \geq 8)$ using rule (2), since
$\absval' \sqsubseteq (x \geq 2)$ and $\absval' \sqsubseteq (x \leq
5)$.  However, if none of the above rules hold true, $\aunit$ returns~$\top$.
 
\paragraph {\textbf{Backjumping}}
After adding $\aunit$ to $\abstransset$, we remove all the meet irreducibles from the trail back to a decision level that restores the solver to a
non-conflicting state.  The backjumping level is defined by the
meet irreducible of the conflict clause that is closest 
to the root (decision level~0) where the conflict
clause is still unit.  If a conflict clause is globally unit, then the
backjumping level is the root of the search tree and
$\analyzeconflict$ returns $\false$, otherwise $\true$.

%The abstract clause learning and backjumping procedures in the abstract 
%conflict graph is stated in terms of the state of ACDCL solver as follows.
%THIS is already explained above
%\[AbsLearn: \quad  (\mathcal{E},S) \rightarrow (\mathcal{E},S \wedge
%\mathcal{L}) \quad \text{if} \; \mathcal{L} \notin S \; \textrm{and}
%\; (S \wedge \mathcal{L}) \; \text{is not UNSAT} \]
%\[AbsBackjump: \quad (\mathcal{E}_1(m,s)\mathcal{E}_2,S) \rightarrow
%(\mathcal{E}_1,S) \quad \text{if} \; (\mathcal{E}_1,S) \; \text{is not in conflict} \]

\textit{Characteristics of Conflict clause}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A conflict clause must include asserting cuts. An asserting cut is a cut
that contain exactly one node at the current decision level. Assertion cuts yields 
clauses that can be used to derive new information after backtracking.

\item A conflict clause must be UNIT after backtracking. 

\item There can be multiple cuts and hence multiple UIPs. In other words, there
can be multiple incomparable reasons for a conflict. But conflict analysis
procedure chooses one that is asserting. 

\item The conflict clause should be made false by the current partial assignment
and thus exclude an assignment leading to conflict.
