\subsection{Lifting First UIP to Octagon domain}
**********************************************
unit-ness guarantee in octagon domain:
  Popped stmt: y23=1+y21
   Abstract value:
   D1: y23-y21 < 2 &&
   D2: y23+y21 > 0 &&
   D3: y21 < 1
   After backtracking, apply unit rule 
   y23 > 1 -- deduction from unit rule
   Value inconsistent !!
 
 Note: 
 1> cannot make reasoning at literal level for relational domain because literals are dependant on each other. As soon as literals denote relation between first-order variables, the pure reasoning on boolean skeleton is not sufficient. 
 
2> Intervals are orthogonal half spaces similar to booleans. 

3> After backtracking, the application of unit rule is done as follows for relational domains:
  Pass the learnt clause (as statement) and the abstrat value to the domain to make deductions.
