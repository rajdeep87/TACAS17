3> Few points for camera-ready: 
a> In contribution section: talk explicitly about propagation heuristic 
instantiation with subdomain. Also, propagation heuristic helps to make 
guided decisions. 
b> Our implementation does not restrict the learnt clause with the initial 
control-flow node unlike the previous work. 
 
4> The previous ACDL instantiation with interval domain was restricted to CFG. 
However, the input to our algorithm is set of SSA. We characterize the BCP phase 
into two phases -- propagation in learnt clauses, and propagation in SSA using 
forward, backward or multi-way strategy. Our ACDL instantiation support product 
domains.
